# BusinessCraft - Current Tasks

## üéØ **CURRENT FOCUS: Ready for Phase 4 - Fabric Implementation**

**OBJECTIVE**: 100% parity with main branch functionality achieved - unified architecture operational

**STATUS**: All critical regressions resolved, core systems fully functional, ready for cross-platform development

## üìã **ACTIVE TASKS**

### **Phase 3.10: Critical Regression Testing - ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

**ALL FUNCTIONALITY VERIFIED WORKING**: User testing confirmed all critical systems operational

### **Completed Systems** ‚úÖ

- [x] **Map View System**: Towns visible, platforms displayed, boundaries rendered - fully functional

- [x] **Town Data Persistence**: All town data persists correctly across save/reload cycles
- [x] **Visit History System**: Visit tracking and persistence working correctly - **USER VERIFIED ‚úÖ**
  - **Visitor History Display**: Fixed duplicate entries (legacy records with 0,0,0 coords vs new records with actual coords)
  - **Smart Deduplication**: Implemented intelligent merging preferring records with valid coordinates
  - **Proper Sorting**: Added timestamp sorting (newest first) matching main branch behavior
- [x] **Platform Creation**: "Add Platform" button working - platform creation functional
- [x] **Platform Destinations**: Destination button opens UI correctly - navigation working
- [x] **Platform Path Setting**: Setting new path works correctly - path creation functional
- [x] **Tourist Chat Messages**: Tourist visits to other towns generating chat messages - messaging system working
- [x] **Debug Logging Cleanup**: All excessive DEBUG-level logs converted to DebugConfig system (149 conversions across 108 files)
- [x] **Critical Crash Fix**: NoSuchMethodError in TouristAllocationTracker.selectFairDestination resolved - tourist spawning operational
- [x] **Tourist Death Crash Fix**: NoSuchMethodError in TownNotificationUtils.displayTouristDepartureNotification resolved - tourist death/kill operational
- [x] **Platform/Boundary Visualization Fix**: Restored missing platform lines and town boundaries after UI exit - Enhanced MultiLoader migration regression resolved
  - Fixed missing PlatformVisualizationPacket network registration
  - Implemented missing BoundarySyncResponsePacket and processBoundarySyncRequest method
  - Fixed boundary visualization timing - now appears instantly when exiting UI (matching main branch behavior)
- [x] **Tourist Population Growth Fix**: Corrected tourist visit population increase system - fully operational
  - **Trade UI Fix**: Emeralds now properly placed in output slot for user after trades
  - **Bread Resource Fix**: Resolved negative bread issue on new towns with tourist spawning
  - **Bread-to-Population Conversion**: Added bread-to-population conversion logic matching main branch behavior
  - **Tourist Visit Population Increase**: Fixed using correct config `populationPerTourist=10` (every 10 tourists = +1 pop) instead of incorrect `touristsPerPopulationIncrease=2`
- [x] **Payment Board Buffer Storage Ghost Items Fix**: Fixed claims not converting to actual clickable items in buffer storage - **USER TESTED ‚úÖ**
  - **Root Cause**: `ForgeBlockEntityHelper.updateBufferStorageUI()` was using legacy `updateBufferStorageItems()` method that collapsed slot data into item counts, losing exact slot positions needed for proper UI display
  - **Solution**: Changed to use slot-based `updateBufferStorageSlots()` method throughout the chain, preserving exact slot positions using `SlotBasedStorage`
  - **Technical Fix**: Modified `ForgeBlockEntityHelper.java:2086-2134` and added `PaymentBoardScreen.updateBufferStorageSlots()` method
  - **Result**: Claimed rewards now appear as proper clickable items in buffer storage instead of disappearing ghost items

## üîß **DEVELOPMENT NOTES**

### **Client Testing Protocol**
- User conducts all testing requiring Minecraft client interaction
- Run: `./gradlew :forge:runClient --args="--username TestUser"`
- Reference main branch behavior as authoritative source
- Report specific issues for systematic debugging

### **Fix Methodology**
1. Test functionality systematically
2. Compare current vs main branch behavior
3. Identify root cause (architectural vs simple bug)
4. Implement fix restoring main branch behavior
5. Verify fix works without breaking other systems

### **Critical Context**
- **Reference Standard**: Main branch functionality is the authoritative source
- **Zero Regression Mandate**: All main branch features must work in unified architecture
- **Build Commands**: `./gradlew build` for compilation, `./gradlew :forge:runClient` for testing
- **Debug Commands**: `/cleartowns` for data reset, F3+K for debug overlay

### **Phase 3.5: Systematic Functionality Testing** - ‚ö†Ô∏è **IN PROGRESS**

**TESTING METHODOLOGY**:
1. **Client Testing Protocol**: User conducts all testing requiring Minecraft client interaction
2. **Reference Standard**: Main branch behavior is the authoritative source for expected functionality
3. **Fix Strategy**: Compare current vs main branch, identify regressions, restore main branch behavior
4. **Progressive Testing**: Complete each system before moving to next

## üöÄ **FUTURE PHASES**

### **Phase 3.11: Critical Architecture Fix** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MUST COMPLETE BEFORE PHASE 4**

- [x] **CRITICAL: Refactor Town Name Resolution Architecture** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Server-side name resolution for visitor history system (Option B)
  - **Architecture Fixed**: Unified approach where server resolves UUID‚Üícurrent town name and sends to client
  - **Key Changes**:
    - ‚úÖ **Visitor History**: Now uses `VisitorHistoryResponsePacket` with server-resolved names
    - ‚úÖ **Payment Board**: Already working with server-side refresh system
    - ‚úÖ **Map View**: Already working correctly with fresh server data
  - **Technical Implementation**:
    - Server resolves names fresh from `TownManager.getTown(uuid).getName()` when requested
    - Client receives resolved names in response packets and displays directly
    - Eliminated client-side UUID‚Üíname resolution complexity in visitor history
    - Static storage (`ModMessages.serverResolvedTownNames`) for async name resolution
  - **Result**: All UIs now show current town names - no more stale cached names after town renaming
  - **Architecture**: Simple and consistent - store UUIDs, server resolves to current names, client displays

### **Phase 4: Fabric Implementation** (2-3 weeks) - ‚úÖ **READY TO START**
- [ ] **Fabric Platform Layer**: Implement minimal Fabric equivalents (networking, menus, events only)
  - Ensure Fabric networking matches Forge NetworkHelper functionality
  - Verify Fabric menu registration and lifecycle management
  - Test Fabric event system integration with unified architecture
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Testing**: Verify feature parity between Forge and Fabric
  - Test town creation, management, and persistence on both platforms
  - Verify payment board system works identically on Forge and Fabric
  - Test platform and destination management across both platforms
- [ ] **Build System Updates**: Configure Gradle for unified + platform approach
  - Optimize build configuration for unified architecture
  - Ensure proper dependency management across common, forge, and fabric modules
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update architecture documentation for new unified approach
  - Document unified architecture patterns and best practices
  - Update development guidelines for the new light platform abstraction approach

### **Phase 5: Cleanup and Optimization** (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] **Remove Enhanced MultiLoader Infrastructure**: Clean up complex abstraction layers
- [ ] **Resolve Architectural Conflicts**: Address hybrid Enhanced MultiLoader/Unified patterns causing unnecessary complexity (e.g., ForgeBlockEntityHelper mixing direct TownManager access with platform service abstractions)
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Refactor Town Name Resolution Architecture** ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**
  - **Problem**: Inconsistent data access patterns for UUID‚Üítown name lookups causing cache invalidation issues
  - **Root Cause**: Two competing architectures in same codebase:
    - ‚úÖ **Map View (Correct)**: Fresh server data via `TownMapDataResponsePacket` - always current town names
    - ‚ùå **Visitor History/Payment Board (Broken)**: Client-side `ClientSyncHelper.townNameCache` with manual invalidation complexity
  - **Symptom**: Map view always shows current town names after renames, but visitor history and payment board show cached old names
  - **Architectural Issue**: UUID‚Üíname lookup should be trivial (`TownManager.get(level).getTown(uuid).getName()`) but has become complex due to client-side caching
  - **Solution Options**:
    - **Option A (Recommended)**: Eliminate client-side town name caching, make all systems work like map view with fresh server-side name resolution
    - **Option B**: Server-side name resolution before sending to client - resolve names fresh in `PaymentBoardResponsePacket` and visitor history packets  
    - **Option C**: Unified client-side town data cache (like map view's `ClientTownMapCache`) instead of fragmented per-component caches
  - **Technical Details**:
    - Remove `ClientSyncHelper.townNameCache` and complex invalidation logic
    - Ensure all UUID‚Üíname lookups use fresh server data or simple network queries
    - Eliminate cache clearing complexity (`clearAllTownNameCaches()` indicates architectural debt)
    - Follow map view pattern: server sends fresh data, client displays without caching names
  - **Impact**: Critical for data consistency - users expect current town names in all UIs after renaming
- [ ] **Review Unimplemented Code**: Systematically review all code containing "not yet implemented", "not implemented", "TODO: Implement", and similar placeholder patterns - either implement functionality or remove dead code
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Direct access should improve performance over service calls
- [ ] **Code Review**: Ensure unified architecture follows best practices
- [ ] **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of natural database-style queries

**‚úÖ ACHIEVED**: 100% functional parity with main branch - ready for cross-platform development
