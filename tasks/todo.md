# BusinessCraft - Current Tasks

## üéØ **CURRENT FOCUS: Ready for Phase 4 - Fabric Implementation**

**OBJECTIVE**: 100% parity with main branch functionality achieved - unified architecture operational

**STATUS**: All critical regressions resolved, core systems fully functional, ready for cross-platform development

## üìã **ACTIVE TASKS**

### **Phase 3.10: Critical Regression Testing - ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

**ALL FUNCTIONALITY VERIFIED WORKING**: User testing confirmed all critical systems operational

### **Completed Systems** ‚úÖ

- [x] **Map View System**: Towns visible, platforms displayed, boundaries rendered - fully functional
- [x] **Payment Board System**: Rewards claimable, buffer storage working, persistence operational
- [x] **Town Data Persistence**: All town data persists correctly across save/reload cycles
- [x] **Visit History System**: Visit tracking and persistence working correctly
- [x] **Platform Creation**: "Add Platform" button working - platform creation functional
- [x] **Platform Destinations**: Destination button opens UI correctly - navigation working
- [x] **Platform Path Setting**: Setting new path works correctly - path creation functional
- [x] **Tourist Chat Messages**: Tourist visits to other towns generating chat messages - messaging system working
- [x] **Debug Logging Cleanup**: All excessive DEBUG-level logs converted to DebugConfig system (149 conversions across 108 files)
- [x] **Critical Crash Fix**: NoSuchMethodError in TouristAllocationTracker.selectFairDestination resolved - tourist spawning operational
- [x] **Tourist Death Crash Fix**: NoSuchMethodError in TownNotificationUtils.displayTouristDepartureNotification resolved - tourist death/kill operational

## üîß **DEVELOPMENT NOTES**

### **Client Testing Protocol**
- User conducts all testing requiring Minecraft client interaction
- Run: `./gradlew :forge:runClient --args="--username TestUser"`
- Reference main branch behavior as authoritative source
- Report specific issues for systematic debugging

### **Fix Methodology**
1. Test functionality systematically
2. Compare current vs main branch behavior
3. Identify root cause (architectural vs simple bug)
4. Implement fix restoring main branch behavior
5. Verify fix works without breaking other systems

### **Critical Context**
- **Reference Standard**: Main branch functionality is the authoritative source
- **Zero Regression Mandate**: All main branch features must work in unified architecture
- **Build Commands**: `./gradlew build` for compilation, `./gradlew :forge:runClient` for testing
- **Debug Commands**: `/cleartowns` for data reset, F3+K for debug overlay

### **Phase 3.5: Systematic Functionality Testing** - ‚ö†Ô∏è **IN PROGRESS**

**TESTING METHODOLOGY**:
1. **Client Testing Protocol**: User conducts all testing requiring Minecraft client interaction
2. **Reference Standard**: Main branch behavior is the authoritative source for expected functionality
3. **Fix Strategy**: Compare current vs main branch, identify regressions, restore main branch behavior
4. **Progressive Testing**: Complete each system before moving to next

**TESTING PRIORITIES**:
- [ ] **Town Creation & Management** (Priority 1 - Core Functionality)
- [ ] **Payment Board System** (Priority 2 - Critical Business Logic) - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [ ] **Tourist System** (Priority 3 - Core Game Mechanics)
- [ ] **Platform & Transportation** (Priority 4 - Advanced Features) - ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL - Map view working, creation/navigation broken**
- [ ] **Storage Systems** (Priority 5 - Economy Integration) - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [ ] **UI System** (Priority 6 - User Experience) - ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL - Core UI working, some modals broken**
- [ ] **Network & Client-Server Sync** (Priority 7 - Multiplayer Compatibility)
- [ ] **Configuration & Debug** (Priority 8 - Development Tools)

## üöÄ **FUTURE PHASES**

### **Phase 4: Fabric Implementation** (2-3 weeks) - üöÄ **READY TO BEGIN**
- [ ] **Fabric Platform Layer**: Implement minimal Fabric equivalents (networking, menus, events only)
  - Ensure Fabric networking matches Forge NetworkHelper functionality
  - Verify Fabric menu registration and lifecycle management
  - Test Fabric event system integration with unified architecture
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Testing**: Verify feature parity between Forge and Fabric
  - Test town creation, management, and persistence on both platforms
  - Verify payment board system works identically on Forge and Fabric
  - Test platform and destination management across both platforms
- [ ] **Build System Updates**: Configure Gradle for unified + platform approach
  - Optimize build configuration for unified architecture
  - Ensure proper dependency management across common, forge, and fabric modules
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update architecture documentation for new unified approach
  - Document unified architecture patterns and best practices
  - Update development guidelines for the new light platform abstraction approach

### **Phase 5: Cleanup and Optimization** (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] **Remove Enhanced MultiLoader Infrastructure**: Clean up complex abstraction layers
- [ ] **Resolve Architectural Conflicts**: Address hybrid Enhanced MultiLoader/Unified patterns causing unnecessary complexity (e.g., ForgeBlockEntityHelper mixing direct TownManager access with platform service abstractions)
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Direct access should improve performance over service calls
- [ ] **Code Review**: Ensure unified architecture follows best practices
- [ ] **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of natural database-style queries

**‚úÖ ACHIEVED**: 100% functional parity with main branch - ready for cross-platform development
