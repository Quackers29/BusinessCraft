  - [x] **Town Boundary Visualization Restoration**: **HIGH PRIORITY - Restore Missing Boundary Display Features** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    
    **🔍 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Town boundary data missing from Enhanced MultiLoader packet structure
    - **Main Branch**: `TownInfo` class includes `boundaryRadius` field for circular boundary rendering
    - **Current Implementation**: Town data lacks boundary radius information for visualization
    - **TownMapModal Issue**: Sophisticated map expects `townInfo.boundaryRadius` for boundary circle calculations
    - **Missing Integration**: Current ForgeBlockEntityHelper doesn't include boundary data in town information

    **Problem**: Towns lose sync on save/reload of world - data store or sync issue during Enhanced MultiLoader migration
    **Main Branch Reference**: Towns persist correctly across world save/reload cycles in main branch
    **Root Cause**: Enhanced MultiLoader abstraction layer requires explicit saveTowns() vs main branch's direct SavedData.setDirty()
    **Priority**: CRITICAL - Core town functionality broken ✅ **FIXED**
    **Resolution Summary**:
    - [x] **Root Cause Identified**: ForgeTownPersistence.load() was returning empty Map instead of reading from TownSavedData
    - [x] **Fix 1**: Updated ForgeTownPersistence.load() to properly restore town data from underlying TownSavedData
    - [x] **Fix 2**: Updated ForgeTownPersistence.save() to properly write town data to TownSavedData for NBT persistence
    - [x] **Fix 3**: Added explicit saveTowns() call in TownManager.createTown() to ensure immediate persistence
    - [x] **Main Branch Analysis**: Confirmed main branch used direct savedData.getTowns().put() + setDirty(), Enhanced MultiLoader needs abstraction layer sync
    - [x] **User Testing**: Towns now persist correctly across save/reload cycles ✅
    - [x] **Architectural Note**: Enhanced MultiLoader abstraction requires explicit save step that main branch didn't need
