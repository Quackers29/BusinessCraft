  - [x] Create `RegistryHelper` interface for cross-platform registration
  - [x] Create `NetworkHelper` interface for networking abstraction
  - [x] Create `EventHelper` interface for event system abstraction

- [x] **1.3 Implement Forge Platform Abstraction**
  - [x] Create `ForgePlatformHelper` with mod loading and environment detection
  - [x] Create `ForgeRegistryHelper` with DeferredRegister integration
  - [x] Create `ForgeNetworkHelper` with SimpleChannel networking
  - [x] Create `ForgeEventHelper` with MinecraftForge event bus integration
  - [x] Create `PlatformServices` provider for accessing platform implementations

- [x] **1.4 Integrate Platform Abstraction into Registration Systems**

  - [x] Abstract `ModEntityTypes` registration including attribute registration
  - [x] Abstract `ModMenuTypes` registration with IForgeMenuType compatibility
  - [x] Update `BusinessCraft` main class to initialize platform registrations
  - [x] Test compilation and runtime compatibility with existing Forge build

#### **Phase 2: Core Mod Architecture**
- [ ] **2.1 Create Platform Abstraction Layer**
  - [ ] Move `BusinessCraft.java` to common module
  - [ ] Create platform-specific mod entry points
  - [ ] Abstract mod initialization logic
  - [ ] Create platform service interfaces

- [ ] **2.2 Registration System Overhaul**
  - [ ] Convert `ModBlocks.java` to Architectury Registry API
  - [ ] Convert `ModBlockEntities.java` to platform-agnostic registration
  - [ ] Convert `ModEntityTypes.java` to cross-platform registration
  - [ ] Convert `ModMenuTypes.java` to platform-agnostic registration
  - [ ] Test registration works on both platforms

#### **Phase 3: Event System Migration**
- [ ] **3.1 Abstract Event Handling**
  - [ ] Convert `ModEvents.java` to platform-agnostic events
  - [ ] Migrate client events (`ClientSetup.java`, `ClientModEvents.java`)
  - [ ] Abstract platform-specific event handlers
  - [ ] Create event registration interfaces
  - [ ] Test event functionality on both platforms

#### **Phase 4: Network System Migration**
- [ ] **4.1 Convert Network Architecture**
  - [ ] Replace `ModMessages.java` with Architectury Networking
  - [ ] Convert 25 packet types to platform-agnostic format
  - [ ] Update packet serialization/deserialization
  - [ ] Abstract client/server packet handling
  - [ ] Test networking on both platforms

#### **Phase 5: Client-Side Rendering**
- [ ] **5.1 Migrate Rendering Systems**
  - [ ] Convert entity renderers to platform-agnostic
  - [ ] Migrate client-side initialization
  - [ ] Abstract rendering registration
  - [ ] Update visualization system for cross-platform
  - [ ] Test rendering on both platforms

#### **Phase 6: Configuration & Final Integration**
- [ ] **6.1 Platform-Specific Metadata**
  - [ ] Create `fabric.mod.json` for Fabric
  - [ ] Keep `mods.toml` for Forge
  - [ ] Update configuration loading for both platforms
  - [ ] Create platform-specific resource packs if needed

- [ ] **6.2 Testing & Verification**
  - [ ] Test full functionality on Forge
  - [ ] Test full functionality on Fabric  
  - [ ] Verify feature parity between platforms
  - [ ] Test mod loading and initialization
  - [ ] Performance testing on both platforms

#### **Phase 7: Documentation & Cleanup**
- [ ] **7.1 Update Documentation**
  - [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with new architecture
  - [ ] Create platform-specific build instructions
  - [ ] Document platform differences
  - [ ] Update development guidelines

### ðŸŽ¯ **MIGRATION STRATEGY**
- **Approach**: Incremental migration maintaining working Forge build until Fabric is ready
- **Testing**: Each phase must compile and run on Forge before proceeding
- **Architecture**: Common module contains business logic, platform modules handle loader-specific code
- **Compatibility**: Maintain full feature parity between Forge and Fabric versions

## ðŸŽ¯ **COMPLETED TASKS** âœ…

## ðŸŽ¯ **FUTURE TASKS**

#### **Phase 3: UI Navigation and Controls**
- [ ] **3.2 Add Filtering and Sorting**
  - Filter by source type (All, Milestones, Tourist Payments, etc.)
  - Sort by timestamp (newest/oldest first)
  - Filter by claim status (unclaimed, claimed, expired)
  - Add search functionality for large reward lists

- [ ] **3.3 Implement Bulk Operations**
  - "Claim All" button with smart inventory management
  - "Claim All [Source Type]" for specific reward categories
  - Bulk expiration cleanup for old rewards
  - Select multiple rewards for batch claiming

- [ ] **3.4 Add Status Indicators**
  - Show total unclaimed rewards count
  - Display reward expiration warnings
  - Add visual indicators for new rewards since last visit
  - Include town economic summary (total rewards earned, claimed, etc.)

#### **Phase 4: Backend Integration (Leveraging Existing Architecture)**
- [ ] **4.1 Update Network Packets (Using Existing Patterns)**
