  - Filter by source type (All, Milestones, Tourist Payments, etc.)
  - Sort by timestamp (newest/oldest first)
  - Filter by claim status (unclaimed, claimed, expired)
  - Add search functionality for large reward lists

- [ ] **3.3 Implement Bulk Operations**
  - "Claim All" button with smart inventory management
  - "Claim All [Source Type]" for specific reward categories
  - Bulk expiration cleanup for old rewards
  - Select multiple rewards for batch claiming

- [ ] **3.4 Add Status Indicators**
  - Show total unclaimed rewards count
  - Display reward expiration warnings
  - Add visual indicators for new rewards since last visit
  - Include town economic summary (total rewards earned, claimed, etc.)

#### **Phase 4: Backend Integration (Leveraging Existing Architecture)**
- [ ] **4.1 Update Network Packets (Using Existing Patterns)**
  - Extend existing storage packet system for payment board data
  - Use `BaseBlockEntityPacket` pattern for reward synchronization
  - Add claim request/response packets following existing packet structure
  - Leverage existing `ModMessages` registration system

- [ ] **4.2 Remove Personal Storage System (Clean Removal)**
  - Remove personal storage from `StandardTabContent` configurations
  - Remove personal storage methods from `Town.java`
  - Clean up personal storage packets in network/packets/storage/
  - Remove personal storage references from UI components

- [ ] **4.3 Create PaymentBoardMenu Container**
  - Create new menu class extending `AbstractContainerMenu` for three-section layout
  - **Top Section**: Payment board data (no slots, pure UI)
  - **Middle Section**: 2x9 Payment Buffer slots (using `ItemStackHandler`)
  - **Bottom Section**: Standard player inventory slots (36 + 9 hotbar)
  - Handle slot interactions: buffer ↔ player inventory, hopper automation

#### **Phase 5: Enhanced Features**
- [ ] **5.1 Enhance Hopper Integration**
  - Ensure Payment Buffer (2x9) works seamlessly with hoppers underneath

  - Toggle for auto-claim functionality
  - Hopper output settings (enabled/disabled)
  - Maximum stored rewards per town

#### **Phase 6: Testing and Polish**
- [ ] **6.1 Comprehensive Testing**
  - Test milestone reward delivery to payment board
  - Test tourist payment processing
  - Verify claim functionality with full/empty inventories
  - Test hopper integration and automation

- [ ] **6.2 Performance Optimization**
  - Optimize reward list rendering for large numbers of entries
  - Implement pagination for performance with 100+ rewards
  - Add caching for frequently accessed reward data
  - Optimize network packet sizes for reward synchronization

- [ ] **6.3 Final Integration**
  - Update all references from storage to payment board
  - Clean up unused storage-related code
  - Update debug logging for payment board operations
  - Verify compatibility with existing town systems
