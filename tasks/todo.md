## üîß **DEVELOPMENT NOTES**

### **Current Architecture State**
- **Unified Architecture**: ‚úÖ Operational with 90% shared code
- **Natural Database Queries**: ‚úÖ Direct access patterns working (`town.getPaymentBoard().getRewards()`)
- **Platform Abstractions**: ‚úÖ Minimal abstractions for networking, menus, events only
- **Business Logic**: ‚úÖ Single source of truth in common module
- **Forge Platform**: ‚úÖ 100% functional parity with main branch achieved

### **Phase 4 Success Criteria**
- **Complete Feature Parity**: All main branch functionality working identically on both platforms
- **Performance Parity**: No performance degradation on either platform
- **Build Stability**: Clean builds with no compilation errors on both platforms
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Comprehensive verification of identical behavior
- **Documentation Complete**: Clear architecture docs and development guidelines

### **Development Commands**
- **Build all platforms**: `./gradlew build`
- **Test Forge**: `./gradlew :forge:runClient --args="--username TestUser"`
- **Test Fabric**: `./gradlew :fabric:runClient --args="--username TestUser"`
- **Clean build**: `./gradlew clean build`

### **Communication Protocol**
- **Primary Method**: Webhook notifications via `https://sawfly-hardy-randomly.ngrok-free.app/webhook/6f7b288e-1efe-4504-a6fd-660931327269?message=[YOUR_MESSAGE]`
- **Client Testing**: User conducts all Minecraft client testing and reports results
- **Reference Standard**: Main branch behavior is authoritative for expected functionality

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Zero Regression Mandate**: All main branch features must work identically
- **Reference Implementation**: Main branch contains the authoritative behavior standard
- **Testing Protocol**: Progressive feature testing with user verification
- **Debug Support**: F3+K debug overlay, `/cleartowns` command, comprehensive logging

## üöÄ **UPCOMING PHASES**

### **Phase 5: Cleanup and Optimization** (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] **Remove Enhanced MultiLoader Infrastructure**: Clean up complex abstraction layers
- [ ] **Resolve Architectural Conflicts**: Address hybrid Enhanced MultiLoader/Unified patterns causing unnecessary complexity (e.g., ForgeBlockEntityHelper mixing direct TownManager access with platform service abstractions)
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Refactor Town Name Resolution Architecture** ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**
  - **Problem**: Inconsistent data access patterns for UUID‚Üítown name lookups causing cache invalidation issues
  - **Root Cause**: Two competing architectures in same codebase:
    - ‚úÖ **Map View (Correct)**: Fresh server data via `TownMapDataResponsePacket` - always current town names
    - ‚ùå **Visitor History/Payment Board (Broken)**: Client-side `ClientSyncHelper.townNameCache` with manual invalidation complexity
  - **Symptom**: Map view always shows current town names after renames, but visitor history and payment board show cached old names
  - **Architectural Issue**: UUID‚Üíname lookup should be trivial (`TownManager.get(level).getTown(uuid).getName()`) but has become complex due to client-side caching
  - **Solution Options**:
    - **Option A (Recommended)**: Eliminate client-side town name caching, make all systems work like map view with fresh server-side name resolution
    - **Option B**: Server-side name resolution before sending to client - resolve names fresh in `PaymentBoardResponsePacket` and visitor history packets  
    - **Option C**: Unified client-side town data cache (like map view's `ClientTownMapCache`) instead of fragmented per-component caches
  - **Technical Details**:
    - Remove `ClientSyncHelper.townNameCache` and complex invalidation logic
    - Ensure all UUID‚Üíname lookups use fresh server data or simple network queries
    - Eliminate cache clearing complexity (`clearAllTownNameCaches()` indicates architectural debt)
    - Follow map view pattern: server sends fresh data, client displays without caching names
  - **Impact**: Critical for data consistency - users expect current town names in all UIs after renaming
- [ ] **Review Unimplemented Code**: Systematically review all code containing "not yet implemented", "not implemented", "TODO: Implement", and similar placeholder patterns - either implement functionality or remove dead code
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Direct access should improve performance over service calls
- [ ] **Code Review**: Ensure unified architecture follows best practices
- [ ] **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of natural database-style queries

### **Success Metrics**
- **Development Speed**: 8-12 week unified architecture vs 10-14 week Enhanced MultiLoader
- **Code Sharing**: 90% shared code vs previous 25%
- **Maintenance**: Simplified cross-platform development
- **Natural Queries**: Direct database-style access between systems
- **Industry Standard**: Following JEI, Jade, Create mod patterns

**Total Project Status**: Phase 3 Complete (‚úÖ 300+ hours) ‚Üí Phase 4 Ready (üéØ Current Focus)
