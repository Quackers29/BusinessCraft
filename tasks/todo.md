# BusinessCraft - Current Tasks

## üéØ **CURRENT FOCUS: UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE MIGRATION**

**OBJECTIVE**: Migrate from Enhanced MultiLoader to Unified Architecture + Light Platform Abstractions for natural database queries and easier cross-platform development

**üìä DECISION RATIONALE**:
- **Analysis Completed** ‚úÖ: Research shows Option B (Unified Architecture + Light Abstractions) is optimal for BusinessCraft
- **Natural Database Queries**: Direct access between town data and payment boards (core requirement!)
- **Industry Proven**: JEI, Jade, Create use similar unified approaches with light platform abstractions
- **90% Shared Code**: vs current 25% - massive maintenance reduction
- **Faster Development**: 8-12 weeks vs 10-14 weeks for Enhanced MultiLoader completion
- **Future-Proof**: Easier Minecraft version updates, simpler for new developers

## üöÄ **UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE MIGRATION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Analysis and Planning** (1-2 weeks) - **READY TO START**
- [ ] **Dependency Analysis**: Map all Minecraft-specific dependencies in current common module
- [ ] **Module Merger Planning**: Design unified structure for Town + TownPaymentBoard integration
- [ ] **Platform Abstraction Design**: Identify minimal platform differences (networking, menus, events only)
- [ ] **Migration Strategy**: Plan step-by-step approach to avoid breaking existing functionality
- [ ] **Backup Strategy**: Create migration branch, ensure rollback capability

### **Phase 2: Core Module Unification** (3-4 weeks)
- [ ] **Move TownPaymentBoard to Common**: Migrate sophisticated payment board system from forge to unified module
- [ ] **Merge Town + PaymentBoard**: Enable direct database-style queries between town data and rewards
- [ ] **Resolve Minecraft Dependencies**: Handle ItemStack, Block, Entity references in unified module
- [ ] **Update Business Logic**: Simplify all cross-system interactions with direct access patterns
- [ ] **Unified Data Persistence**: Single save/load system for all town data including payment boards

### **Phase 3: Light Platform Abstractions** (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] **Minimal Platform Services**: Create light abstractions for only essential differences:
  - **Networking**: Platform-specific packet handling
  - **Menus**: UI registration and lifecycle
  - **Events**: Platform event system integration
- [ ] **Remove Complex Services**: Eliminate 274 platform service calls with direct access
- [ ] **Forge Platform Layer**: Minimal Forge-specific implementations (networking, menus, events)
- [ ] **Keep Existing UI**: Preserve sophisticated UI framework with direct data access

### **Phase 4: Fabric Implementation** (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] **Fabric Platform Layer**: Implement minimal Fabric equivalents (networking, menus, events)
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Testing**: Verify feature parity between Forge and Fabric
- [ ] **Build System Updates**: Configure Gradle for unified + platform approach
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update architecture documentation for new unified approach

### **Phase 5: Cleanup and Optimization** (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] **Remove Enhanced MultiLoader Infrastructure**: Clean up complex abstraction layers
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Direct access should improve performance over service calls
- [ ] **Code Review**: Ensure unified architecture follows best practices
- [ ] **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of natural database-style queries

## üéØ **MIGRATION BENEFITS**

**Primary Goal Achieved**: `town.getPaymentBoard().getUnclaimedVisitorRewards()` - exactly what you wanted!

**Additional Benefits**:
- **Single Source of Truth**: All town data (population, resources, payment boards) in one place
- **Faster Development**: New features work on both platforms automatically
- **Easier Debugging**: Issues affect unified code, not platform-specific branches
- **Simple Updates**: Most Minecraft version changes only affect unified module
- **Zero External Dependencies**: No third-party API risks (Architectury, FFAPI, etc.)
- **Functionality Preservation**: All main branch features preserved during migration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **MIGRATION CONSTRAINTS**

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS** (PRESERVED):
- **FUNCTIONALITY PRESERVATION MANDATE**: Any features that worked in main branch MUST continue working in this unified implementation
- **PRESERVE ALL EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY**: Forge implementation must retain 100% of features from main branch
- **REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION**: The `main` branch contains the fully functional Forge implementation prior to architectural changes

**DEVELOPMENT APPROACH**:
- **When investigating issues**: Always reference main branch implementation as the authoritative source
- **When functionality is broken**: Compare current implementation against main branch to identify regressions
- **When implementing fixes**: Restore main branch behavior, then adapt for unified architecture compatibility
- **When in doubt**: Main branch implementation is always the correct reference for expected behavior (AS IN BEHAVIOR SEEN BY THE USER)

**MIGRATION RISKS & MITIGATIONS**:
- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality during merger
- **Mitigation**: Incremental migration with comprehensive testing at each step
- **Risk**: Fabric platform differences more complex than expected
- **Mitigation**: Start with minimal Fabric implementation, expand iteratively
- **Risk**: Performance regressions from unified approach
- **Mitigation**: Direct access should improve performance vs current service calls

## üìñ **BRANCH REFERENCE GUIDE**

- **`main` branch**: Production-ready Forge implementation (reference for all functionality)
- **`fabric` branch** (current): Enhanced MultiLoader Template implementation in progress ‚Üí Unified Architecture migration
- **Goal**: Fabric branch should have identical functionality to main branch + Fabric platform support

## üéâ **EXPECTED OUTCOME**

BusinessCraft with unified architecture supporting:
- **Natural Database Queries**: Direct access between all town systems
- **Easier Maintenance**: 90% shared code vs current 25%
- **Seamless Forge+Fabric Development**: Single codebase, dual platform support
- **100% Feature Parity**: All main branch functionality preserved and enhanced
