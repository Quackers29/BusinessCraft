# BusinessCraft - Current Tasks

## üéØ **CURRENT FOCUS: PAYMENT BOARD SYSTEM RESTORATION**

**OBJECTIVE**: Restore sophisticated Payment Board functionality from main branch within Enhanced MultiLoader architecture

### **üîç ANALYSIS COMPLETED**
Based on analysis of main branch vs current Enhanced MultiLoader implementation:

**‚úÖ Main Branch System**:
- **TownPaymentBoard**: 370-line sophisticated reward management system
- **RewardEntry**: Complete reward tracking (UUID, timestamps, expiration, source tracking, metadata)
- **RewardSource enum**: 7 reward types (MILESTONE, TOURIST_PAYMENT, TRADE, etc.) with icons
- **ClaimStatus enum**: UNCLAIMED/CLAIMED/EXPIRED status tracking
- **SlotBasedStorage**: 2x9 slot inventory system with NBT serialization
- **Advanced Features**: Reward expiration (7 days), cleanup (30 days), metadata system, smart claiming

**‚ùå Current Implementation**: 
- Basic sample rewards in ForgeBlockEntityHelper (1 Bread + 2 Bottles o' Enchanting)
- Missing real reward generation from tourist arrivals and milestones
- No reward expiration, metadata, or advanced management
- No integration with existing TownPaymentBoard system in forge module

### **üìã RESTORATION TASKS**

**Priority**: HIGH - Core economic system functionality missing

- [x] **Task 1: Platform Service Integration** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - [x] Add `getPaymentBoard(Object town)` method to ITownManagerService interface ‚úÖ
  - [x] Implement method in ForgeTownManagerService to bridge common Town ‚Üí forge TownPaymentBoard ‚úÖ
  - [x] Test that common module can access forge payment board through platform services ‚úÖ
  - [x] Verify compilation and service initialization ‚úÖ
  - [x] Successfully enabled real payment board access in DistanceMilestoneHelper ‚úÖ

- [x] **Task 2: ForgeBlockEntityHelper Integration** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - [x] Replace sample reward generation with real TownPaymentBoard integration ‚úÖ
  - [x] Update `getUnclaimedRewards` method to use town.getPaymentBoard() instead of sample data ‚úÖ
  - [x] Update `claimPaymentBoardReward` method to use real TownPaymentBoard.claimReward() system ‚úÖ
  - [x] Ensure PaymentBoardResponsePacket uses real RewardEntry data from TownPaymentBoard ‚úÖ
  - [x] Replace all reflection-based town access with direct Enhanced MultiLoader service calls ‚úÖ

- [ ] **Task 3: Real Reward System Implementation**
  - [ ] Integrate tourist arrival reward creation using RewardSource.TOURIST_ARRIVAL
  - [ ] Integrate distance milestone reward creation using RewardSource.MILESTONE
  - [ ] Replace all sample reward generation with actual reward processing from town business logic
  - [ ] Test that tourists and milestones generate real rewards in payment board

- [ ] **Task 4: Advanced Features Verification**
  - [ ] Test reward expiration system (7 days default, 30 day cleanup)
  - [ ] Test reward metadata and source tracking functionality
  - [ ] Test buffer storage system (2x9 slots) with UI integration
  - [ ] Verify all reward filtering, sorting, and bulk operations work

- [ ] **Task 5: Comprehensive Testing and Validation**
  - [ ] Test complete payment board workflow: town creation ‚Üí tourist arrival ‚Üí milestone ‚Üí rewards ‚Üí claiming
  - [ ] Compare functionality with main branch to ensure feature parity
  - [ ] Verify save/load persistence works correctly with sophisticated payment board
  - [ ] Test performance and stability with multiple towns and rewards

### **üéØ EXPECTED OUTCOME**
- **Complete Payment Board System**: All main branch features working in Enhanced MultiLoader architecture
- **Real Reward Generation**: Tourist arrivals and milestones create actual rewards
- **Advanced Management**: Expiration, metadata, source tracking, bulk operations all functional
- **UI Integration**: Sophisticated payment board data displays correctly in existing UI
- **Feature Parity**: Enhanced MultiLoader implementation matches main branch functionality exactly

### **üîß TECHNICAL APPROACH**
- **Keep Enhanced MultiLoader Compliance**: TownPaymentBoard stays in forge module (already exists)
- **Platform Service Bridge**: Use ITownManagerService to connect common Town class to forge TownPaymentBoard
- **Preserve Architecture**: No Minecraft dependencies in common module, all platform-specific code in forge module
- **Leverage Existing System**: Use existing TownPaymentBoard implementation rather than recreating

## üéØ **FUTURE TASKS**

### **Cross-Platform Validation** (After Payment Board Complete)
- [ ] Test Fabric platform payment board integration (when Fabric feature parity is needed)
- [ ] Verify cross-platform save file compatibility
- [ ] Complete Enhanced MultiLoader Template validation

### **Performance and Polish**
- [ ] Optimize payment board rendering for large numbers of rewards
- [ ] Add configuration options for reward expiration times
- [ ] Performance testing with multiple towns and active tourism

## üìä **COMPLETED WORK**
- **Enhanced MultiLoader Architecture**: ‚úÖ Complete (see tasks/done.md)
- **Platform Services**: ‚úÖ All 9 interfaces implemented and operational
- **Core Functionality**: ‚úÖ Town management, platform creation, boundary visualization, trading system
- **Critical Issues**: ‚úÖ All major UI and persistence issues resolved
- **Feature Parity Foundation**: ‚úÖ Forge platform ready for sophisticated payment board integration
