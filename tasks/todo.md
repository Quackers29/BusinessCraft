### **Replace Platform Distance Validation with Town Boundary System**

**Goal**: Modify platform path placement system to use town boundaries instead of hardcoded 50-block distance limit.

**Current Implementation**:
- Platform placement uses hardcoded `MAX_PATH_DISTANCE = 50` (Manhattan distance)
- Validation in `PlatformPathHandler.java:118-120` and `TownBlockEntity.java:645-647`
- Uses `pos.distManhattan(townPos) <= MAX_PATH_DISTANCE`

**New Implementation Plan**:
- [x] **1. Update PlatformPathHandler.java**
  - Replace `isValidPathDistance()` method to use town boundary validation
  - Add town lookup via `TownManager.get(ServerLevel).getTown(townId)`
  - Use `town.getBoundaryRadius()` instead of hardcoded distance
  - Switch from Manhattan distance to Euclidean distance (consistent with boundary system)

- [x] **2. Update TownBlockEntity.java**
  - Modify `isValidPathDistance()` method to use boundary-based validation
  - Remove `MAX_PATH_DISTANCE` constant (lines around 139)
  - Add method to get associated town and use its boundary radius

- [x] **3. Update Error Messages**
  - Change "Point too far from town!" to boundary-specific message
  - Include actual boundary radius in error message for clarity

- [x] **4. Test Implementation**
  - Test with different town populations (different boundary sizes)
  - Verify platform placement works within boundaries
  - Verify platform placement fails outside boundaries
  - Test edge cases near boundary limits

**Technical Details**:
- Town boundary radius = town population (1:1 ratio)
- Boundary system uses Euclidean distance: `Math.sqrt(pos1.distSqr(pos2))`
- TownBlockEntity can access town via: `TownManager.get(sLevel).getTown(townId)`
- Town provides `getBoundaryRadius()` method for validation

## ðŸŽ¯ **FUTURE TASKS**

#### **Phase 3: UI Navigation and Controls**
- [ ] **3.2 Add Filtering and Sorting**
  - Filter by source type (All, Milestones, Tourist Payments, etc.)
  - Sort by timestamp (newest/oldest first)
  - Filter by claim status (unclaimed, claimed, expired)
  - Add search functionality for large reward lists

- [ ] **3.3 Implement Bulk Operations**
  - "Claim All" button with smart inventory management
  - "Claim All [Source Type]" for specific reward categories
  - Bulk expiration cleanup for old rewards
  - Select multiple rewards for batch claiming

- [ ] **3.4 Add Status Indicators**
  - Show total unclaimed rewards count
  - Display reward expiration warnings
  - Add visual indicators for new rewards since last visit
  - Include town economic summary (total rewards earned, claimed, etc.)

#### **Phase 4: Backend Integration (Leveraging Existing Architecture)**
- [ ] **4.1 Update Network Packets (Using Existing Patterns)**
  - Extend existing storage packet system for payment board data
  - Use `BaseBlockEntityPacket` pattern for reward synchronization
  - Add claim request/response packets following existing packet structure
  - Leverage existing `ModMessages` registration system

- [ ] **4.2 Remove Personal Storage System (Clean Removal)**
  - Remove personal storage from `StandardTabContent` configurations
  - Remove personal storage methods from `Town.java`
  - Clean up personal storage packets in network/packets/storage/
  - Remove personal storage references from UI components

- [ ] **4.3 Create PaymentBoardMenu Container**
  - Create new menu class extending `AbstractContainerMenu` for three-section layout
  - **Top Section**: Payment board data (no slots, pure UI)
  - **Middle Section**: 2x9 Payment Buffer slots (using `ItemStackHandler`)
  - **Bottom Section**: Standard player inventory slots (36 + 9 hotbar)
  - Handle slot interactions: buffer â†” player inventory, hopper automation

#### **Phase 5: Enhanced Features**
- [ ] **5.1 Enhance Hopper Integration**
  - Ensure Payment Buffer (2x9) works seamlessly with hoppers underneath
  - Add auto-claim settings: automatically claim rewards to buffer
  - Implement smart claiming: prefer "Claim" to inventory, fallback to buffer
  - Add configuration for auto-claim behavior per reward type

- [ ] **5.2 Implement Notification System**
  - Send notifications when new rewards are available
  - Add sound effects for successful claims
  - Include particle effects for milestone reward notifications
  - Create notification preferences (on/off per source type)

- [ ] **5.3 Add Configuration Options**
  - Configurable reward expiration times
  - Toggle for auto-claim functionality
  - Hopper output settings (enabled/disabled)
  - Maximum stored rewards per town

#### **Phase 6: Testing and Polish**
- [ ] **6.1 Comprehensive Testing**
  - Test milestone reward delivery to payment board
  - Test tourist payment processing
  - Verify claim functionality with full/empty inventories
  - Test hopper integration and automation

- [ ] **6.2 Performance Optimization**
  - Optimize reward list rendering for large numbers of entries
  - Implement pagination for performance with 100+ rewards
  - Add caching for frequently accessed reward data
  - Optimize network packet sizes for reward synchronization

- [ ] **6.3 Final Integration**
  - Update all references from storage to payment board
  - Clean up unused storage-related code
  - Update debug logging for payment board operations
  - Verify compatibility with existing town systems
