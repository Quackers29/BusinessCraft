## üéØ **IMMEDIATE TASKS** (Do not remove header)

### Town Boundary Messages & Map Visualization Implementation

**Status**: Map boundary visualization is ‚úÖ **ALREADY WORKING**! Only player boundary messages need implementation.

**Background**: The user wants:
1. Town boundary circles displayed on map when a town is clicked (‚úÖ already working)
2. Entry/exit messages when players cross town boundaries with config toggle (‚ùå needs implementation)

#### **Phase 1: Configuration System** 
- [ ] **1.1 Add townBoundaryMessages config property**
  - Add `public static boolean townBoundaryMessages = true;` to ConfigLoader.java
  - Add property loading in `loadConfig()` method: `townBoundaryMessages = Boolean.parseBoolean(props.getProperty("townBoundaryMessages", "true"));`
  - Add property saving in `saveConfig()` method: `props.setProperty("townBoundaryMessages", String.valueOf(townBoundaryMessages));`
  - Add logging: `LOGGER.info("Town Boundary Messages: {}", townBoundaryMessages);`
  - Test hot-reload functionality works with new property

#### **Phase 2: Player Movement Tracking System**
- [ ] **2.1 Create PlayerBoundaryTracker.java**
  - Create new file in `src/main/java/com/yourdomain/businesscraft/event/PlayerBoundaryTracker.java`
  - Implement `@Mod.EventBusSubscriber` with `TickEvent.PlayerTickEvent` handler
  - Add player position tracking with previous position storage
  - Use `Map<UUID, PlayerBoundaryState>` to track each player's boundary state
  - Store previous town (if any) and current position for comparison

- [ ] **2.2 Implement PlayerBoundaryState tracking**
  - Create internal class to store: `currentTown`, `previousPosition`, `lastNotificationTime`
  - Add rate limiting to prevent message spam (minimum 2-second delay between messages)
  - Handle player join/leave events to clean up tracking data

#### **Phase 3: Boundary Detection Logic**
- [ ] **3.1 Implement boundary checking logic**
  - Use existing `TownManager.get(ServerLevel).getTowns()` to get all towns for checking
  - Leverage existing `TownBoundaryService.calculateBoundaryRadius(Town)` for radius calculation
  - Use existing distance calculation pattern: `double distance = Math.sqrt(playerPos.distSqr(townPos));`
  - Determine if player is inside boundary: `distance <= town.getBoundaryRadius()`

- [ ] **3.2 Add entry/exit detection**
  - Compare current town vs previous town to detect transitions
  - Handle cases: no town ‚Üí town (entry), town ‚Üí no town (exit), town A ‚Üí town B (exit A, enter B)
  - Add boundary overlap handling for multiple towns with overlapping boundaries
  - Prevent duplicate messages during rapid boundary crossings

#### **Phase 4: Message Display System**
- [ ] **4.1 Implement boundary messages**
  - Use action bar messages (above hotbar): `player.displayClientMessage(Component.literal(message), true);`
  - Follow existing styling patterns from `TownNotificationUtils.java`
  - Entry message: `üèòÔ∏è Welcome to [townname]` with `ChatFormatting.AQUA, ChatFormatting.BOLD`
  - Exit message: `üëã Leaving [townname]` with `ChatFormatting.YELLOW`
  - Add config check: only send messages if `ConfigLoader.townBoundaryMessages` is true

- [ ] **4.2 Add message customization**
  - Ensure consistent emoji and color usage with existing notification system
  - Add proper message timing (display for 3 seconds above hotbar)
  - Handle edge cases: player moving too fast, server lag, overlapping boundaries

#### **Phase 5: Integration & Testing**
- [ ] **5.1 Test basic functionality**
  - Test config toggle properly enables/disables messages
  - Verify messages appear above hotbar (not in chat)
  - Test with single player crossing various town boundaries
  - Ensure no performance impact during normal gameplay

- [ ] **5.2 Test edge cases and performance**
  - Test with multiple players crossing boundaries simultaneously  
  - Test rapid movement through multiple town boundaries
  - Test with boundary changes due to population growth
  - Verify cleanup of player tracking data on disconnect
  - Test server restart/reload handling

#### **Implementation Notes**

**Existing Infrastructure to Leverage:**
- ‚úÖ **Boundary Visualization**: Map boundaries already work perfectly when clicking towns
- ‚úÖ **Boundary Calculation**: `TownBoundaryService.java` handles population-based radius calculation
- ‚úÖ **Configuration System**: `ConfigLoader.java` with hot-reload support ready for new property
- ‚úÖ **Message System**: `TownNotificationUtils.java` patterns for action bar messages
- ‚úÖ **Town Management**: `TownManager.get(level).getTowns()` provides all town data

**Key Files to Modify:**
1. `ConfigLoader.java` - Add `townBoundaryMessages` property (5 lines)
2. **New:** `PlayerBoundaryTracker.java` - Main implementation (~100 lines)
3. Optional: `TownBoundaryService.java` - Minor utility additions if needed

**Architecture Quality:**
The existing codebase has excellent infrastructure for this feature. The boundary visualization system is already complete and working. This implementation leverages existing systems perfectly.

**Estimated Time:** 45-60 minutes total implementation time.

### Population-Based Town Boundaries Implementation

#### **Phase 1: Data Model and Boundary System**
- [x] **1.1 Add Town Boundary Methods to Town.java**
  - Add `getBoundaryRadius()` method that returns current population (1:1 ratio)
  - Add `getPosition()` accessor for town center coordinates
  - Add validation method `wouldOverlapWith(Town other)` for boundary overlap checks
  
- [x] **1.2 Create TownBoundaryService.java**
  - Create new service class in `town/service/` package
  - Implement `calculateBoundaryRadius(Town town)` - returns town population as radius
  - Implement `checkTownPlacement(BlockPos newPos, Collection<Town> existingTowns)` - validates placement
  - Implement `getMinimumDistanceRequired(Town town1, Town town2)` - calculates required distance
  - Include logic: minDistance = town1.boundary + town2.boundary

#### **Phase 2: Update Town Placement Logic**
- [x] **2.1 Modify TownManager.canPlaceTownAt()**
  - Replace static `minDistanceBetweenTowns` config usage with dynamic boundary calculation
  - For new towns: use `defaultStartingPopulation` (5) as initial boundary radius
  - For existing towns: use current population as boundary radius
  - Calculate required distance as: existingTown.boundary + newTown.boundary
  
- [x] **2.2 Update Block Placement Error Messages**
  - Modify error messages in `TownBlock.java` and `TownInterfaceBlock.java`
  - Show dynamic distance requirements instead of static config value
  - Format: "Town requires X blocks distance (your boundary: Y + nearby town boundary: Z)"

#### **Phase 3: Boundary Growth Handling**
- [ ] **3.1 Add Population Change Event System**
  - Create `TownPopulationChangeEvent` class in events package
  - Trigger event when town population increases/decreases
  - Include old population, new population, and boundary radius changes
  
- [ ] **3.2 Implement Boundary Overlap Detection**
  - Add method to detect when growing boundaries would overlap existing towns
  - Create validation system to prevent population increases that would cause overlaps
  - Log warnings when towns approach boundary conflicts
  
- [x] **3.3 Add Boundary Visualization**
  - **World Visualization**: Create `TownBoundaryVisualizationRenderer` extending `WorldVisualizationRenderer`
  - **Circle Rendering**: Implement circular boundary rendering in `BoundaryRenderer3D.java` (currently has placeholder)
  - **Integration**: Add `TYPE_TOWN_BOUNDARY = "town_boundary"` to `VisualizationManager`
  - **Trigger**: Show boundary circles when platform visualization is active (same trigger as platforms)
  - **Colors**: Green=safe spacing, yellow=close to overlap, red=would overlap
  - **Map Display**: Add boundary radius display to `TownMapModal.java` map view

#### **Phase 4: Configuration and Backward Compatibility**
- [ ] **4.1 Update Configuration System**
  - Keep `minDistanceBetweenTowns` config as fallback/minimum distance override
  - Add new config: `enablePopulationBasedBoundaries=true`
  - Add config: `minTownBoundaryRadius=5` (minimum boundary regardless of population)
  - Add config: `maxTownBoundaryRadius=50` (maximum boundary cap)
  
- [ ] **4.2 Migration Support**
  - Ensure existing towns work correctly with new boundary system
  - Validate existing town positions don't violate new boundary rules
  - Add debug logging for boundary calculations during world load

#### **Phase 5: Implementation Details**

**World Visualization Architecture:**
- Extend existing `VisualizationManager` system (supports TYPE_PLATFORM, TYPE_ROUTE, etc.)
- `BoundaryRenderer3D.java` already has circular boundary placeholder methods ready to implement
- Use same trigger system as platforms: when town interface is accessed, show both platform lines AND boundary circles
- Integration point: `PlatformVisualizationRenderer.showPlatformVisualization()` ‚Üí also trigger boundary visualization

**Map Display Integration:**
- `TownMapModal.java` already displays town positions and data
- Add boundary radius as visual circles around town markers
- Show radius value in town info panel
- Color-code based on proximity to other towns

**Circle Rendering Implementation:**
```java
// In BoundaryRenderer3D.java - implement the placeholder method
public static void renderCircularBoundary(PoseStack poseStack, BlockPos center, int radius, Color color) {
    List<Vec3> points = createCircularBoundaryPoints(center, radius, 32); // 32 segments for smooth circle
    renderPolygonBoundary(poseStack, points, color, config);
}
```

#### **Phase 6: Testing and Validation**
- [ ] **6.1 Unit Testing**
  - Test boundary calculation with various population levels
  - Test town placement validation with multiple existing towns
  - Test edge cases: towns at world border, very high populations
  
- [ ] **6.2 Integration Testing**
