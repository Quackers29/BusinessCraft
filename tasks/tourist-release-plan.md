# Tourist Release Plan - BusinessCraft v1.0

## üéØ **Release Goal: Core Tourism Economy**
Create a complete tourism experience where players transport tourists between towns for rewards and progression.

## üìã **Implementation Phases**

### **Phase 1: Core Tourism Mechanics (Priority: Critical)**

#### **1.1 Tourist Spawning System** ‚≠ê
- **Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Description**: Tourists already spawn at town platforms
- **Current State**: Working - tourists spawn based on population and platform configuration

#### **1.2 Inter-Town Transport System** ‚≠ê
- **Status**: ‚ùì NEEDS VERIFICATION

#### **1.3 Distance-Based Reward System** ‚≠ê
- **Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Description**: Rewards calculated based on distance between origin and destination towns
- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Implement distance calculation algorithm (FIXED - now uses actual town positions)
  - [x] Create reward scaling system (emeralds, resources)
  - [x] Add milestone bonuses for long-distance transport (configurable distances/rewards)
  - [x] Store rewards in destination town's communal storage
- **Recent Fixes**:
  - Fixed origin town position calculation bug (was using 0,0,0)
  - Fixed distance accumulation for multiple tourists from same town
  - Added configurable milestone system with item rewards

#### **1.4 Tourist Delivery Detection** ‚≠ê
- **Status**: ‚ùì NEEDS VERIFICATION
- **Description**: System detects when tourist reaches destination platform
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Verify tourist arrival detection at destination platforms
  - [ ] Implement reward distribution upon successful delivery
  - [ ] Add visual/audio feedback for successful deliveries

### **Phase 2: Progression & Feedback (Priority: High)**

#### **2.1 Storage System Enhancement** ‚≠ê
- **Status**: ‚ùå NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
- **Description**: Fix communal storage overflow issue
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Investigate current 2x9 slot system with infinite overflow
  - [ ] Design solution: enforce max slots or create expanded storage interface
  - [ ] Implement chosen solution to prevent rapid storage fill
  - [ ] Test with milestone rewards and tourist payments

#### **2.2 Scoreboard Integration** ‚≠ê
- **Status**: ‚ùå NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
- **Description**: Use Minecraft scoreboard to track town statistics
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Implement TownScoreboardManager enhancements
  - [ ] Track: population, tourists delivered, total rewards, distance records
  - [ ] Add per-player statistics (deliveries made, total distance)
  - [ ] Create scoreboard display commands (/bc stats, /bc leaderboard)

#### **2.3 Achievement/Milestone System** 
- **Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (Distance Milestones)
- **Description**: Reward players for tourism milestones
- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Distance milestones (configurable thresholds with item rewards)
  - [ ] First tourist delivery bonus
  - [ ] Volume milestones (10, 50, 100+ tourists)
  - [ ] Special rewards for connecting distant towns

### **Phase 3: User Experience (Priority: Medium)**

#### **4.2 Balance Tuning**
- **Status**: ‚ùå NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
- **Description**: Tune reward values and spawn rates
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Test reward scaling at various distances
  - [ ] Adjust tourist spawn rates for gameplay balance
  - [ ] Set appropriate milestone thresholds
  - [ ] Configure default platform search radius
