Features performance-optimized tracking (10-tick intervals, 4-block threshold), 2-second rate limiting, action bar display (`🏘️ Welcome to [townname]` / `👋 Leaving [townname]`), and dual config toggles (`playerTracking` master + `townBoundaryMessages` specific).

✅ **COMPLETED** - Platform Placement Boundary Integration: Replaced hardcoded 50-block distance limit with dynamic town boundary system for platform path placement. Modified `PlatformPathHandler.java` and `TownBlockEntity.java` to use `town.getBoundaryRadius()` (population-based 1:1 ratio) instead of `MAX_PATH_DISTANCE` constant. Switched from Manhattan to Euclidean distance for consistency with boundary system. Enhanced error messages to show actual distance, boundary radius, and population (`"Distance: X.X blocks, Town boundary: Y blocks (Population: Z)"`). Platform placement now scales naturally with town growth - small towns have restricted placement areas while large towns allow platforms much further out.

### **Phase 3.10: Critical Regression Testing** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**ALL FUNCTIONALITY VERIFIED WORKING**: User testing confirmed all critical systems operational

### **Phase 3.11: Critical Architecture Fix** ✅ **COMPLETED**

- [x] **CRITICAL: Refactor Town Name Resolution Architecture** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Server-side name resolution for visitor history system (Option B)
  - **Architecture Fixed**: Unified approach where server resolves UUID→current town name and sends to client
  - **Key Changes**:
    - ✅ **Visitor History**: Now uses `VisitorHistoryResponsePacket` with server-resolved names
    - ✅ **Payment Board**: Already working with server-side refresh system
    - ✅ **Map View**: Already working correctly with fresh server data
  - **Technical Implementation**:
    - Server resolves names fresh from `TownManager.getTown(uuid).getName()` when requested
    - Client receives resolved names in response packets and displays directly
    - Eliminated client-side UUID→name resolution complexity in visitor history
    - Static storage (`ModMessages.serverResolvedTownNames`) for async name resolution
  - **Result**: All UIs now show current town names - no more stale cached names after town renaming
  - **Architecture**: Simple and consistent - store UUIDs, server resolves to current names, client displays

### **Completed Systems** ✅

- [x] **Map View System**: Towns visible, platforms displayed, boundaries rendered - fully functional
- [x] **Payment Board System**: Rewards claimable, buffer storage working, persistence operational
- [x] **Town Data Persistence**: All town data persists correctly across save/reload cycles
- [x] **Visit History System**: Visit tracking and persistence working correctly - **USER VERIFIED ✅**
  - **Visitor History Display**: Fixed duplicate entries (legacy records with 0,0,0 coords vs new records with actual coords)
  - **Smart Deduplication**: Implemented intelligent merging preferring records with valid coordinates
  - **Proper Sorting**: Added timestamp sorting (newest first) matching main branch behavior
- [x] **Platform Creation**: "Add Platform" button working - platform creation functional
- [x] **Platform Destinations**: Destination button opens UI correctly - navigation working
- [x] **Platform Path Setting**: Setting new path works correctly - path creation functional
- [x] **Tourist Chat Messages**: Tourist visits to other towns generating chat messages - messaging system working
- [x] **Debug Logging Cleanup**: All excessive DEBUG-level logs converted to DebugConfig system (149 conversions across 108 files)
- [x] **Critical Crash Fix**: NoSuchMethodError in TouristAllocationTracker.selectFairDestination resolved - tourist spawning operational
- [x] **Tourist Death Crash Fix**: NoSuchMethodError in TownNotificationUtils.displayTouristDepartureNotification resolved - tourist death/kill operational
- [x] **Platform/Boundary Visualization Fix**: Restored missing platform lines and town boundaries after UI exit - Enhanced MultiLoader migration regression resolved
  - Fixed missing PlatformVisualizationPacket network registration
  - Implemented missing BoundarySyncResponsePacket and processBoundarySyncRequest method
  - Fixed boundary visualization timing - now appears instantly when exiting UI (matching main branch behavior)
- [x] **Tourist Population Growth Fix**: Corrected tourist visit population increase system - fully operational
  - **Trade UI Fix**: Emeralds now properly placed in output slot for user after trades
  - **Bread Resource Fix**: Resolved negative bread issue on new towns with tourist spawning
  - **Bread-to-Population Conversion**: Added bread-to-population conversion logic matching main branch behavior
  - **Tourist Visit Population Increase**: Fixed using correct config `populationPerTourist=10` (every 10 tourists = +1 pop) instead of incorrect `touristsPerPopulationIncrease=2`
- [x] **Payment Board Buffer Storage Ghost Items Fix**: Fixed claims not converting to actual clickable items in buffer storage - **USER TESTED ✅**
  - **Root Cause**: `ForgeBlockEntityHelper.updateBufferStorageUI()` was using legacy `updateBufferStorageItems()` method that collapsed slot data into item counts, losing exact slot positions needed for proper UI display
  - **Solution**: Changed to use slot-based `updateBufferStorageSlots()` method throughout the chain, preserving exact slot positions using `SlotBasedStorage`
  - **Technical Fix**: Modified `ForgeBlockEntityHelper.java:2086-2134` and added `PaymentBoardScreen.updateBufferStorageSlots()` method
  - **Result**: Claimed rewards now appear as proper clickable items in buffer storage instead of disappearing ghost items
