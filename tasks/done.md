- Maintained server authority while eliminating client-server conflicts

### **Code Architecture** âœ…
- Created PlatformManagementScreenV2 and DestinationsScreenV2
- Refactored button handlers to use indices instead of object references
- Updated all navigation points (TownInterfaceScreen, ButtonActionCoordinator, packets)
- Index-based platform actions prevent stale reference issues

---

**Files Created**: PlatformManagementScreenV2.java, DestinationsScreenV2.java

**Status**: Production-ready with all functionality preserved and enhanced


âœ… **COMPLETED** - PR002 - Platform UI Add Button Fix: Fixed add platform button so it doesn't close the UI, updates list in-place instead.

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Platform UI Delete Button Fix: Added missing delete functionality to PlatformManagementScreenV2. Delete button appears for the last platform only (matching V1 behavior).

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Platform UI Redesign: Moved delete button to header as "Delete Last", restored Set/Reset Path functionality, and fixed UI refresh issues.

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Platform UI Refresh Fix: Implemented PaymentBoardScreen pattern for immediate UI updates on add/delete operations.
