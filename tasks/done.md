  - ✅ **Applied to**: Both path lines (green) and boundary lines (orange)
  - ✅ **Result**: Lines now render as genuinely thick, visible lines in 3D space

- [x] **9. Fix Line Appearance Issues**
  - ✅ **Line Separation**: Reduced from 0.05 to 0.0005 (100x smaller) - individual lines no longer visible

- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Map Coordinate Overlap Fix: Added overlap detection to prevent Z-axis coordinate labels from rendering when they would interfere with town info panel visibility.

- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Current Town Bounds Enforcement: Modified current town marker positioning to always stay within map boundaries by clamping screen coordinates 4 pixels from edges.

- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Grid Marker Density Increase: Updated coordinate spacing algorithm from targeting 5 markers per axis to 7 markers per axis for improved reference density.

- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Town Name Sync Fix: Resolved desync between map modal, overview tab, and edit popup after town renaming by adding comprehensive cache invalidation to SetTownNamePacket. Now invalidates both ClientTownMapCache (30s TTL) and TownDataCache (5s TTL) plus force-refreshes all UI tabs for immediate synchronization.

- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Tourist Minecart Vibration Fix: Identified and fixed visual vibration issue in minecarts caused by expiry shaking effect in TouristRenderer. Removed isShaking() override to eliminate all tourist shaking behavior.

- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Tourist Expiry System Optimization: Restored proper expiry tracking for tourists in stationary vehicles while maintaining non-vibrating behavior. Tourists now expire correctly when stationary regardless of riding state, with cleaned up movement detection logic.

✅ **COMPLETED** - Population-Based Town Boundaries System: Replaced static `minDistanceBetweenTowns=10` config with dynamic population-based boundaries (1:1 ratio). Towns now calculate placement distance as sum of both boundaries, with real-time circular boundary visualization triggered alongside platform visuals for 30 seconds.

✅ **COMPLETED** - Town Boundary Visualization Implementation: Created comprehensive boundary rendering system with immediate server sync on UI close, client-side boundary data registry, and hidden visualization until first server response. Integrated with existing platform visualization timing and modular 3D rendering framework.

✅ **COMPLETED** - Player Boundary Messages System: Implemented configurable town entry/exit messages with `PlayerBoundaryTracker.java` using server-side TickEvent handlers. Features performance-optimized tracking (10-tick intervals, 4-block threshold), 2-second rate limiting, action bar display (`🏘️ Welcome to [townname]` / `👋 Leaving [townname]`), and dual config toggles (`playerTracking` master + `townBoundaryMessages` specific).

✅ **COMPLETED** - Platform Placement Boundary Integration: Replaced hardcoded 50-block distance limit with dynamic town boundary system for platform path placement. Modified `PlatformPathHandler.java` and `TownBlockEntity.java` to use `town.getBoundaryRadius()` (population-based 1:1 ratio) instead of `MAX_PATH_DISTANCE` constant. Switched from Manhattan to Euclidean distance for consistency with boundary system. Enhanced error messages to show actual distance, boundary radius, and population (`"Distance: X.X blocks, Town boundary: Y blocks (Population: Z)"`). Platform placement now scales naturally with town growth - small towns have restricted placement areas while large towns allow platforms much further out.
