âœ… **COMPLETED** - PR002 - Platform UI Add Button Fix: Fixed add platform button so it doesn't close the UI, updates list in-place instead.

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Platform UI Delete Button Fix: Added missing delete functionality to PlatformManagementScreenV2. Delete button appears for the last platform only (matching V1 behavior).

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Platform UI Redesign: Moved delete button to header as "Delete Last", restored Set/Reset Path functionality, and fixed UI refresh issues.

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Platform UI Refresh Fix: Implemented PaymentBoardScreen pattern for immediate UI updates on add/delete operations.

  - âœ… Changed from hardcoded radius of 1 to actual `townBlockEntity.getSearchRadius()`
  - âœ… Now uses configurable search radius from town configuration
  - âœ… Boundary correctly scales with town's actual tourist detection radius

- [x] **6. Fix Visibility Timer Logic**
  - âœ… Created `PlatformVisualizationManager` for client-side state tracking
  - âœ… Added `PlatformVisualizationPacket` for server-to-client communication
  - âœ… Implemented 30-second timer matching original particle system

  - âœ… **Solution**: Implemented thick line rendering using multiple parallel lines
  - âœ… **Technical**: Created 5x5 grid of parallel lines with 0.05 block offsets
  - âœ… **Applied to**: Both path lines (green) and boundary lines (orange)
  - âœ… **Result**: Lines now render as genuinely thick, visible lines in 3D space

- [x] **9. Fix Line Appearance Issues**
  - âœ… **Line Separation**: Reduced from 0.05 to 0.0005 (100x smaller) - individual lines no longer visible
  - âœ… **Boundary Height**: Lowered from +1.0 to +0.1 blocks above ground (near ground level)
  - âœ… **Path Line Height**: Lowered from +1.0 to +0.1 blocks above ground (consistent with boundary)

  - âœ… **Build Status**: Successfully compiled and ready for testing

- [x] **10. Final Thickness and Height Adjustments**
  - âœ… **Line Thickness**: Increased by 10x (5x5 grid â†’ 11x11 grid, 0.0005 â†’ 0.005 separation)

- âœ… **COMPLETED** - 3D Quad Rendering: Converted 2D flat quads to full 3D rectangular prisms with 6 faces. Lines now appear thick from any viewing angle with proper vertex handling for vertical lines.

- âœ… **COMPLETED** - Line Thickness Adjustment: Reduced thickness from 0.1 to 0.05 blocks (50% reduction) while maintaining 3D appearance for both path and boundary lines.

- âœ… **COMPLETED** - Modular Platform 3D Line Rendering System: Extracted platform visualization into reusable framework with LineRenderer3D, BoundaryRenderer3D, PathRenderer3D, WorldVisualizationRenderer, and VisualizationManager. Zero breaking changes, ready for territory/route/debug/quest visualizations.

- âœ… **COMPLETED** - Platform Visualization Cleanup: Removed deprecated PlatformLineRenderer, PlatformVisualizationManager, and PlatformVisualizationHelper. Updated TownBlockEntity to use new modular system. All functionality preserved with cleaner architecture.

- âœ… **COMPLETED** - Town Map Modal Implementation: Replaced 'Manage Platforms' button with interactive map view. Features north-oriented map, pan/zoom controls, town markers with names, recenter button, distance/coordinate display on click, edge indicators for off-map towns, and proper network synchronization.

- âœ… **COMPLETED** - Map Coordinate Overlap Fix: Added overlap detection to prevent Z-axis coordinate labels from rendering when they would interfere with town info panel visibility.

- âœ… **COMPLETED** - Current Town Bounds Enforcement: Modified current town marker positioning to always stay within map boundaries by clamping screen coordinates 4 pixels from edges.

- âœ… **COMPLETED** - Grid Marker Density Increase: Updated coordinate spacing algorithm from targeting 5 markers per axis to 7 markers per axis for improved reference density.

- âœ… **COMPLETED** - Town Name Sync Fix: Resolved desync between map modal, overview tab, and edit popup after town renaming by adding comprehensive cache invalidation to SetTownNamePacket. Now invalidates both ClientTownMapCache (30s TTL) and TownDataCache (5s TTL) plus force-refreshes all UI tabs for immediate synchronization.

- âœ… **COMPLETED** - Tourist Minecart Vibration Fix: Identified and fixed visual vibration issue in minecarts caused by expiry shaking effect in TouristRenderer. Removed isShaking() override to eliminate all tourist shaking behavior.

- âœ… **COMPLETED** - Tourist Expiry System Optimization: Restored proper expiry tracking for tourists in stationary vehicles while maintaining non-vibrating behavior. Tourists now expire correctly when stationary regardless of riding state, with cleaned up movement detection logic.

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Population-Based Town Boundaries System: Replaced static `minDistanceBetweenTowns=10` config with dynamic population-based boundaries (1:1 ratio). Towns now calculate placement distance as sum of both boundaries, with real-time circular boundary visualization triggered alongside platform visuals for 30 seconds.

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Town Boundary Visualization Implementation: Created comprehensive boundary rendering system with immediate server sync on UI close, client-side boundary data registry, and hidden visualization until first server response. Integrated with existing platform visualization timing and modular 3D rendering framework.
