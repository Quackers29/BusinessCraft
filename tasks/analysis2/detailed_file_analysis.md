- No component lifecycle management (init/destroy)
- Memory leaks possible with event handler map not being cleared
- Missing accessibility support for disabled users

### BCPanel.java (Container Component)
Panel container component with layout management, scrolling support, and child component organization. Handles automatic layout application and provides hierarchical component structure with named child access.

**Critical Issues:**
- Layout and scrolling logic mixed into single class
- Inefficient child component searching (linear iteration)
- Scroll calculations don't account for varying child heights
- No virtualization for large numbers of child components

## Game Logic Implementation

### TownBlockEntity.java (Core Town Block)
Massive 998-line block entity implementing the core town functionality including tourist management, platform operations, resource handling, and data synchronization. Contains multiple helper classes for modular functionality and extensive NBT serialization.

**Critical Issues:**
- Violates single responsibility principle with too many concerns
- 200+ lines just for imports indicate architectural issues
- Complex state management across multiple helper classes
- No transaction support for multi-step operations
- Tourist spawning logic deeply coupled to block entity lifecycle
- Missing error recovery for corrupted town data

## Network Architecture

### ModMessages.java (Network Packet Registration)
Central network message registration system handling client-server communication setup with proper packet validation and routing.

**Critical Issues:**
- All packet types registered in single file creates tight coupling
- No packet versioning for mod updates
- Missing network security validation
- No bandwidth limiting or rate limiting capabilities

## UI Component System

### BCComponentFactory.java (Component Factory)
Factory class providing standardized component creation with consistent styling through theme system. Implements builder patterns for complex component configuration.

**Critical Issues:**
- Factory methods are too generic, not domain-specific
- No component pooling for performance optimization
- Theme system not properly integrated with all component types
- Missing validation for component creation parameters

### UIGridBuilder.java (Grid Layout System)
Complex grid layout system with scrolling, element management, and rendering capabilities. Handles mouse interactions and dynamic content updates.

**Critical Issues:**
- Monolithic class handling layout, scrolling, and rendering
- Grid cell calculations don't handle dynamic content sizing
- Mouse event handling is error-prone with coordinate transformations
- No keyboard navigation support for accessibility

## Modal and Screen Management

### BCModalScreen.java (Modal Window System)
Full-page modal window component with responsive sizing, scrollable content, and standardized button layouts. Provides complex layout capabilities with grid integration.

**Critical Issues:**
- Modal stacking not properly managed
- No modal backdrop click handling
- Focus management issues when modals are nested
- Screen size calculations don't handle all display ratios

### TownInterfaceScreen.java (Main Interface)
Primary game interface screen managing tabs, modals, and town data display with extensive event handling and component coordination.

**Critical Issues:**
- Screen class size likely exceeds maintainable limits
- Tab management and modal coordination in single class
- No state machine for screen transitions
- Missing proper cleanup when screen is closed

## Data Management Systems

### TownManager.java (Town Data Management)
Core town data management system handling persistence, town lifecycle, and inter-town communication with proper world-level isolation.

**Critical Issues:**
- No data migration strategy for format changes
- Missing backup mechanism for town data corruption
- Town lookup performance may degrade with many towns
- No proper transaction isolation for concurrent access

### Cache Management Systems
Various cache management classes handle client-side data caching with TTL support and synchronization mechanisms.

**Critical Issues:**
- Multiple cache implementations without unified interface
- No cache size limits leading to potential memory leaks
- Cache invalidation strategies are inconsistent
- Missing cache warming strategies for performance

## Service Layer

### TouristVehicleManager.java (Tourist Management)
