# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Instructions

"AI models are geniuses who start from scratch on every task." - Noam Brown

Your job is to "onboard" yourself to the current task.

Do this by:

- Using ultrathink
- Exploring the codebase
- Asking me questions if needed

The goal is to get you fully prepared to start working on the task.

Take as long as you need to get yourself ready. Overdoing it is better than underdoing it.

Record everything in a .claude/tasks/[TASK_ID]/onboarding.md file. This file will be used to onboard you to the task in a new session if needed, so make sure it's comprehensive.

## Standard Workflow

0. Always read ALL of CLAUDE.md and tasks/todo.md every time the user has prompted you to continue on so this stays fresh.
1. First, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them.
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan. Use the webhook communication method to notify me prior to any input to get my attention (including when you complete).
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, keep on marking them off as you go in the file so I can track progress.
5. **Client Testing Protocol**: If any testing requires user interaction with the Minecraft client (UI testing, gameplay verification, save/reload cycles, etc.), notify me to conduct the testing instead of attempting automated testing.
6. Finally, if you have noticed you have move onto your next task, move the previously completed task to the bottom of the done.md file, using similar style to whats already in the end of that file.

## Communication Protocol

**PRIMARY COMMUNICATION METHOD**: Use webhook notifications to communicate with the user during development work.

### Webhook Communication
- **URL**: `https://sawfly-hardy-randomly.ngrok-free.app/webhook/6f7b288e-1efe-4504-a6fd-660931327269?message=[YOUR_MESSAGE]`
- **Usage**: Send messages via WebFetch tool to notify user of progress, completion, or need for input
- **Response**: User responds through Telegram integration linked to the webhook
- **Stop Protocol**: If user responds with 'stop', finish current task and return to command line communication
- **Default Method**: Use this for all notifications, progress updates, and requests for user input

### Legacy Communication
- **Beep Command**: `powershell.exe -Command "[console]::beep(800,200); Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 200; [console]::beep(800,200); Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 200; [console]::beep(800,200)"`
- **Usage**: Fallback method only when webhook is not available

## Project Overview

## üö® **CRITICAL PROJECT CONTEXT**

**üèóÔ∏è MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL DECISION**: **UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE MIGRATION** ‚úÖ

**NEW DIRECTION**: Migrate from Enhanced MultiLoader to Unified Architecture + Light Platform Abstractions (Option B)

**üìä DECISION RATIONALE**:
- **Analysis Completed**: Comprehensive research of successful Forge+Fabric mods (JEI, Jade, Create)
- **Core Issue Identified**: Enhanced MultiLoader prevents natural database queries between town data and payment boards
- **Better Approach Found**: Unified architecture with 90% shared code vs current 25%
- **Faster Development**: 8-12 weeks vs 10-14 weeks for Enhanced MultiLoader completion
- **Industry Proven**: Leading mods use similar unified approaches with minimal platform abstractions

**üìã CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS** (PRESERVED FROM ORIGINAL):
- **FUNCTIONALITY PRESERVATION MANDATE**: Any features that worked in main branch MUST continue working in this unified implementation
- **PRESERVE ALL EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY**: Forge implementation must retain 100% of features from main branch
- **Zero External Dependencies**: No third-party API risks (Architectury, FFAPI, etc.)
- **REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION**: The `main` branch contains the fully functional Forge implementation prior to architectural changes

**üéØ NEW PROJECT GOALS**:
1. **Primary Goal**: Unified architecture enabling natural database-style queries (`town.getPaymentBoard().getUnclaimedVisitorRewards()`)
2. **Secondary Goal**: Forge + Fabric support with minimal platform abstractions (networking, menus, events only)
3. **Critical Requirement**: Single source of truth for all town data including payment boards
4. **Mandatory Requirement**: Zero functionality regression from main branch implementation

**‚ö†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT APPROACH**:
- **When investigating issues**: Always reference main branch implementation as the authoritative source
- **When functionality is broken**: Compare current implementation against main branch to identify regressions
- **When implementing fixes**: Restore main branch behavior, then adapt for unified architecture compatibility
- **When in doubt**: Main branch implementation is always the correct reference for expected behavior (AS IN BEHAVIOR SEEN BY THE USER)
- **Migration Strategy**: 5-phase approach from Enhanced MultiLoader to Unified Architecture
- **Phase 1**: Analysis and planning (1-2 weeks) - map dependencies, design unified structure
- **Phase 2**: Core unification (3-4 weeks) - merge Town + TownPaymentBoard, resolve dependencies
- **Phase 3**: Light abstractions (2-3 weeks) - minimal platform differences only
- **Phase 4**: Fabric implementation (2-3 weeks) - simple platform layer vs complex service replication
- **Phase 5**: Cleanup (1-2 weeks) - remove Enhanced MultiLoader infrastructure

**üìñ BRANCH REFERENCE GUIDE**:
- **`main` branch**: Production-ready Forge implementation (reference for all functionality)
- **`fabric` branch** (current): Enhanced MultiLoader Template implementation in progress ‚Üí Unified Architecture migration
- **Goal**: Fabric branch should have identical functionality to main branch + Fabric platform support

**üìñ ARCHITECTURE TRANSITION**:
- **FROM**: Enhanced MultiLoader Template with complex 9-service abstraction layer
- **TO**: Unified codebase with minimal platform abstractions (networking, menus, events)
- **REFERENCE**: JEI, Jade, Create mod patterns for industry-proven unified approach
- **GOAL**: Natural data relationships, easier maintenance, faster cross-platform development
- **CONSTRAINT**: Must preserve 100% of main branch user-visible functionality

### Multi-Platform Architecture

**Target Platforms**: Minecraft Forge 1.20.1 + Fabric 1.20.1 (full feature parity)
**Architecture Pattern**: Unified Codebase + Light Platform Abstractions

**CRITICAL**: BusinessCraft uses **Unified Architecture with Minimal Platform Abstractions** for cross-platform compatibility. This architectural decision was made after comprehensive analysis of Enhanced MultiLoader limitations and research of successful cross-platform mods.

#### Why Unified Architecture (Not Enhanced MultiLoader)
- **Natural Data Relationships**: Direct database-style queries between town data and payment boards
- **90% Shared Code**: Massive reduction in maintenance burden vs Enhanced MultiLoader's 25%
- **Industry Proven**: Used by JEI, Jade, Create and other major successful mods
- **Faster Development**: New features automatically work on both platforms
- **Simple Platform Differences**: Abstract only essentials (networking, menus, events)
- **Zero External Dependencies**: No third-party API risks (Architectury, FFAPI, etc.)

#### Unified Architecture Migration Status
- **Current State**: Enhanced MultiLoader Template operational but with identified limitations
  - ‚úÖ **Forge Module**: Complete functionality with sophisticated payment board system
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Enhanced MultiLoader**: 274 platform service calls creating complex data bridges
  - ‚ùå **Core Issue**: No natural database queries between town data and payment boards
- **Migration Plan**: 5-phase unified architecture migration (8-12 weeks total)
  - **Phase 1**: Analysis and Planning (READY TO START)
  - **Phase 2**: Core Module Unification - merge Town + TownPaymentBoard
  - **Phase 3**: Light Platform Abstractions - networking, menus, events only  
  - **Phase 4**: Fabric Implementation - simple platform layer
  - **Phase 5**: Cleanup - remove Enhanced MultiLoader infrastructure
- **Target Outcome**: 90% shared code, natural data queries, easier maintenance

- Tourist processing and reward systems active

**Fabric Platform** (‚ö†Ô∏è Partial):
- Platform services working correctly
- Network packet system functional
- UI framework operational
- **MISSING**: Town management business logic (needs common module migration)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Architectural Migration Needed

**Current Issue**: Core business logic in forge module violates Enhanced MultiLoader principle
- `TownManager` (forge module) - should be in common
- `TownSavedData` (forge module) - should use DataStorageHelper abstraction  
- `Town` class dependencies need platform abstraction review

### Key Architectural Patterns

**MultiLoader Template Pattern**: Cross-platform compatibility through service abstraction
**Provider Pattern**: Consistent data access through `ITownDataProvider`
**Service-Oriented Architecture**: Platform services (`PlatformServices`, `RegistryHelper`, `NetworkHelper`, `EventHelper`)
**Component-Based UI**: Reusable components with composition over inheritance
**Separation of Concerns**: Clear layer separation between UI, data, and logic
**Event-Driven Design**: Clean event handling throughout UI system
**Maximum Common Code**: Business logic abstracted to common module
**Rate Limiting**: Smart performance optimizations in rendering and updates

## File Organization

## Multi-Platform Development Guidelines

### MANDATORY: Enhanced MultiLoader Approach
**All development must follow the MultiLoader Template pattern. Do not use:**
- Architectury API (dependency risk, performance overhead)
- Forgified Fabric API (experimental, unnecessary complexity)
- Platform-specific development (abandons abstraction work)

### Platform Abstraction Rules
1. **Maximize Common Code**: All business logic goes in common module
2. **Service-Oriented Design**: Use `PlatformServices` for all platform operations
3. **Zero Platform Dependencies in Common**: Common module must compile without Forge or Fabric
4. **Complete Feature Parity**: Fabric implementation must match Forge functionality exactly
5. **Performance Priority**: Direct platform APIs, no unnecessary abstraction layers

### Code Organization Rules
- **Business Logic**: Always in common module (town management, economy, calculations)
- **UI Components**: Always in common module (already 100% platform-agnostic)
- **Network Packets**: Definitions in common, serialization through platform services
- **Platform Services**: Only in platform-specific modules
- **Registration**: Platform-specific implementations of common interfaces

## Development Guidelines

### Working with the UI Framework
- Use `BCScreenBuilder` for all new screens - provides fluent API
- Leverage layout managers (`BCFlowLayout`, `BCGridLayout`, `BCFlexLayout`)
- Follow `BCTheme` system for consistent styling
- Use `BCModalGridScreen` for data display tables
- Implement state binding through `StateBindingManager`

### Multi-Platform Development Best Practices
- **Platform Services**: Always use `PlatformServices.getXXXHelper()` for platform operations
- **Common Module First**: Implement business logic in common, then create platform implementations
- **Service Interfaces**: Define interfaces in common, implement in platform modules
- **Testing Strategy**: Test both platforms for feature parity

### Data Management Best Practices
- Access town data via `TownManager.get(ServerLevel)`
- Use helper classes in `town.data` package for complex operations
- Implement proper cleanup in server lifecycle events
- Cache frequently accessed data through `TownDataCacheManager`
- **Platform Abstraction**: Use service interfaces for inventory, networking, events

### Network Development (Enhanced MultiLoader Complete ‚úÖ)
- **Platform Abstraction**: Use `NetworkHelper` interface for all networking
- **Achievement**: 26+ packets successfully migrated to common module with platform services
- Extend `BaseBlockEntityPacket` for block entity-related packets
- Organize new packets in appropriate subdirectories  
- Register all packets through `PlatformServices.getNetworkHelper()`
- **Common Definitions**: Packet classes in common, serialization through platform services
- **Status**: All packet functionality restored and working on both platforms

### Performance Considerations
- UI components use virtualization for large lists
- Particle effects are optimized with rate limiting
- Client-side caching reduces server requests
- Proper resource cleanup on server stop/level unload

### Testing and Debugging
- **Client Testing Protocol**: If any testing requires user interaction with the Minecraft client (UI testing, gameplay verification, save/reload cycles, etc.), notify me to conduct the testing instead of attempting automated testing.
- **User Testing Instructions**: When Claude needs client testing:
  1. Notify user with specific test instructions 
  2. User runs: `./gradlew runClient` 
  3. User performs requested testing and reports results back
  4. Claude continues based on user feedback
- F3+K toggles town debug overlay  
- Debug commands available through `/cleartowns`
- Comprehensive logging throughout all systems

### Event System (Platform-Agnostic ‚úÖ)
- **EventHelper Interface**: Common module defines platform-agnostic event registration
- **Platform Implementations**: ForgeEventHelper and FabricEventHelper handle platform-specific events
- **Usage Pattern**: ModEvents and PlayerBoundaryTracker use `PlatformServices.getEventHelper()`
- **Achievement**: Complete abstraction without moving files - already properly structured

## Enhanced MultiLoader Architecture Status

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED SYSTEMS**
- **Platform Services**: All 7 service interfaces implemented (NetworkHelper, EventHelper, etc.)
- **Packet Architecture**: 26+ packets migrated with platform abstraction
- **Event System**: Platform-agnostic event handling via EventHelper pattern
- **Build System**: Both Forge and Fabric compile and launch successfully
- **Code Restoration**: All temporarily disabled functionality restored and working

### üéØ **CURRENT MILESTONE: Ready for Phase 9.8**
- **Foundation**: Rock-solid Enhanced MultiLoader Template implementation
- **Risk Level**: VERY LOW - all core systems tested and working
- **Next Steps**: Fabric platform integration and comprehensive testing

## Configuration
