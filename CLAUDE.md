# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Standard Workflow

0. Always read ALL of CLAUDE.md and tasks/todo.md every time the user has prompted you to continue on so this stays fresh.
1. First, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. Read tasks/toImprove.md, this is a log of future improvements to be made but not the current task, update as needed
3. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them.
4. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan. Use the 'Notify User' command to notify me prior to any input to get my attention (including when you complete).
5. Then, begin working on the todo items, keep on marking them off as you go in the file so I can track progress.
6. Finally, if you have noticed you have move onto your next task, move the previously completed task to the bottom of the done.md file, using similar style to whats already in the end of that file.

## Development Guidelines

### Working with the UI Framework
- Use `BCScreenBuilder` for all new screens - provides fluent API
- Leverage layout managers (`BCFlowLayout`, `BCGridLayout`, `BCFlexLayout`)
- Follow `BCTheme` system for consistent styling
- Use `BCModalGridScreen` for data display tables
- Implement state binding through `StateBindingManager`

### Data Management Best Practices
- Access town data via `TownManager.get(ServerLevel)`
- Use helper classes in `town.data` package for complex operations
- Implement proper cleanup in server lifecycle events
- Cache frequently accessed data through `TownDataCacheManager`

### Network Development
- Extend `BaseBlockEntityPacket` for block entity-related packets
- Organize new packets in appropriate subdirectories
- Register all packets in `ModMessages`
- Follow existing serialization patterns

### Performance Considerations
- UI components use virtualization for large lists
- Particle effects are optimized with rate limiting
- Client-side caching reduces server requests
- Proper resource cleanup on server stop/level unload

### Testing and Debugging
- Use `./gradlew runClient` for development testing
- F3+K toggles town debug overlay
- Debug commands available through `/cleartowns`
- Comprehensive logging throughout all systems

## Configuration
- `ConfigLoader` handles TOML configuration files
- Configurable: minimum distances, tourist capacities, population ratios
- Integration hooks for Create mod trains and economy mods
