# BusinessCraft Mod - Issues to Fix
Last Updated: March 4, 2023

## Issues Found:
- [2023-03-04 04:45] Duplicate import of ServerLevel in BusinessCraft.java (lines 25 and 27)
- [2023-03-04 04:50] RESOURCE_SYSTEM.md mentions a TownEconomyComponent but doesn't provide examples or implementation details
- [2023-03-04 04:57] Inconsistency in debug key documentation: UserManual.txt previously mentioned F3+K but TownDebugKeyHandler uses F4
- [2023-03-09 15:30] TownBlockScreen.java uses both resourceList and slot components from the "resources" tab but there's no clear documentation on how they interact
- [2023-03-09 15:32] TownBlockScreen.java seems to have a lot of code related to platform path creation that might be better separated into its own class
- [2023-03-09 15:33] TownBlockScreen.java contains numerous UI components but no clear accessibility features for screen readers or keyboard navigation
- [2023-03-09 15:40] PlatformsTab.java has an excessive amount of UI constants and color definitions that could be moved to a central UI theming class
- [2023-03-09 15:50] DestinationsScreen.java has three different constructors with overlapping parameters that could be simplified using a builder pattern
- [2023-03-09 16:10] PacketHandler.java seems to duplicate functionality already present in ModMessages.java
- [2023-03-14 12:30] PlatformPathHandler.java and ModEvents.java have significant code duplication for path creation handling, could be refactored to share common code
- [2023-03-14 12:45] TouristVehicleManager.java relies on command strings for Create mod integration which is fragile and could break if the Create mod changes its command structure

## Block System Issues:
- TownBlock.java: Consider adding a confirmation dialog before removing a town block to prevent accidental deletion
- TownBlockEntity.java: File is extremely large (1885 lines) and should be refactored into smaller components
- ModBlockEntities.java: Missing JavaDoc comments for public methods and fields

## Command System Issues:
- ClearTownsCommand.java: Add confirmation parameter to prevent accidental clearing of all towns
- Missing additional admin commands for individual town management

## Registry System Issues:
- ModBlocks.java: Consider adding more descriptive item properties for the town block item
- Empty directories (capability, systems, init) should be removed or populated with implementation files
