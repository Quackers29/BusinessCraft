## Features
### Town System
- Place town blocks in the world to create and manage towns
- Towns persist between server restarts

### Town Management System
- Towns are automatically registered when town blocks are placed
- Each town has a unique identifier (UUID) for reliable tracking
- Towns must be placed at least a minimum distance apart (configurable)
- The system prevents placing towns too close to existing ones
- Town data is automatically saved when the server stops
- Resources can be added to towns through the town block interface
- The system can automatically clean up "ghost towns" with zero population
- All town data persists between server restarts
- Towns can be removed using the town block or admin commands

### Resource System
- Towns can now store multiple types of resources, not just bread
- Place any Minecraft item in the town block's input slot to add it as a resource
- Bread still contributes to population growth
- Other resources are stored for future features like crafting and trading
- View your town's resources in the resource list in the town interface
- Resources persist when the server stops and starts
- Resources are displayed in a scrollable list with the highest quantities at the top
- Use the scroll buttons or mouse wheel to navigate through your resources
- Each resource shows its icon and current quantity

### Tourist System
- Tourists will visit your town once it reaches a certain population
- Tourists are custom entities with special behaviors
- They will interact with your town and its resources
- Tourists have a distinctive appearance with special hats
- Tourists will start shaking when they're about to leave (last 30 seconds)
- Tourists can wear custom heads and hold items
- Only adult tourists wear the special tourist hat
- Baby tourists (if any) will not have the special hat
- Tourists have random villager professions
- Tourists will leave after a configurable amount of time
- Tourists will notify your town when they die
- Tourists will notify your town when they leave (if they've moved from their spawn point)
- Putting tourists in minecarts or trains extends their stay
- Tourists can travel between towns or to any town
- Tourists cannot breed or pick up items

### Platform and Path System
- Create platforms in your town for tourists to visit
- Use the path creation mode to connect platforms
- Press ESC to exit path creation mode
- Paths determine how tourists navigate between platforms

### Debug Features
- Press F4 to toggle the town debug overlay
- The debug overlay visualizes town boundaries, tourist paths, and other technical details
- Information displayed includes:
  - Town position and ID
  - Population and bread count
  - Tourist spawning status
  - Path information
  - Search radius and visitor statistics
- Use the mouse wheel to scroll through information when multiple towns exist
- The overlay automatically refreshes data from the server every second
- The debug system works across all loaded dimensions
- This feature is primarily for development and troubleshooting

## Tourist Vehicle System
The BusinessCraft mod includes a sophisticated system for tourists to use vehicles:

### Minecart Integration
- Tourists can automatically board vanilla Minecraft minecarts
- Minecarts must be stopped (not moving) for tourists to board
- Only empty minecarts will be boarded by tourists
- Tourists from your town will only board minecarts near your town's paths
- Once a tourist boards a minecart, they will remain there until the ride is over
- Tourists riding in minecarts have their expiry time extended
- Minecarts are recognized and tracked by the system automatically
- No special setup required - just place minecarts along your tourist paths

### Create Mod Integration
If you have the Create mod installed, BusinessCraft offers enhanced features:

- Tourists can board Create mod trains and carriages
- The system detects stopped trains automatically
- Multiple tourists can board different seats in the same train
- The system handles finding and assigning free seats
- Create carriages must be completely stopped for boarding
- Tourists will only board trains near your town's paths
- Tourists riding in Create trains have their expiry time extended
- Create integration can be disabled in the configuration

### Configuration Options
- `enableMinecarts` - Turn vanilla minecart integration on/off
- `enableCreateTrains` - Turn Create mod integration on/off (requires Create mod)
- `minecartStopThreshold` - How still a vehicle must be to be considered "stopped"
- Configure these options in the mod's configuration file

### How It Works
1. The system searches around your town's paths for tourists and vehicles
2. It identifies which vehicles are currently stopped
3. It finds tourists from your town who aren't already passengers
4. It matches available tourists with stopped vehicles
5. Once boarded, tourists will stay in the vehicle until it stops again or they expire
6. The vehicle system runs automatically without player intervention

## Configuration
BusinessCraft uses TOML configuration files. These files can be edited with any text editor.

### Resource System Configuration
- The `breadPerPop` setting in the configuration determines how much bread is required for one population unit

### Tourist Configuration
- The `touristExpiryMinutes` setting determines how long tourists will stay before leaving
- The `notifyOnTouristDeparture` setting controls whether notifications appear when tourists leave
- The `enableTouristExpiry` setting can be used to disable tourist expiration entirely

## API System

The BusinessCraft mod provides a robust API system for developers and mod integrations through the ITownDataProvider interface.

### Town Data Provider

The ITownDataProvider interface serves as the central access point for all town-related data:

- **Consistent Data Access**: Access town information such as ID, name, population, and tourist counts through standardized methods.
- **Resource Management**: Add, remove, and query resources using both legacy methods (getBreadCount) and the new generic resource system.
- **Tourist Management**: Control tourist spawning behavior, set search radius, and manage maximum tourist limits.
- **Visit History**: Track and query the history of tourists visiting your town, including origin information and timestamps.
- **Path Configuration**: Configure and query path-related settings for tourist navigation.

### Integration Points

Developers can access the town data provider to:
- Build custom UIs that display town statistics
- Create add-ons that enhance town functionality
- Develop cross-mod compatibility with other economy or town management mods
- Implement custom resource management systems

### Visit History System

The visit history system tracks tourist movement between towns:

- **Initial Setup**: When placed, a town block will:
  - Generate a random town name from the configuration
  - Register the town with the Town Manager
  - Create a default platform extending from the block
  - The platform will be oriented based on the direction you're facing when placing the block

### Town Block Interface

Right-clicking on a Town Block opens the Town Block Menu, which provides access to:
- Resource management
- Town statistics
- Platform configuration
- Tourist spawning settings

### Platforms

Each town can have up to 5 platforms that serve as tourist spawn and destination points:
- **Creating Platforms**: Use the Town Block interface to add new platforms
- **Configuring Platforms**: Set the start and end positions of each platform
- **Enabling/Disabling**: Toggle platforms on or off to control tourist spawning
- **Destinations**: Configure which towns tourists from this platform can travel to

### Tourist Management

The Town Block controls tourist spawning and management:

### Removing a Town Block

Breaking a Town Block will:
- Remove the town from the Town Manager
- Delete all associated data including platforms and visit history
- Release all tourists currently visiting the town

## Scoreboard System

BusinessCraft integrates with Minecraft's scoreboard system to provide at-a-glance information about all towns in your world.

### Town Statistics Scoreboard

The mod automatically creates and updates a scoreboard that displays:
- **Town Population**: The number of villagers in each town
- **Tourist Status**: Whether tourist spawning is enabled (ON) or disabled (OFF)
- **Total Visitors**: The cumulative number of tourists who have visited the town

### Viewing the Scoreboard

The town statistics scoreboard is displayed in the sidebar of your Minecraft interface. You can see it by:
1. Looking at the right side of your screen
2. If it's not visible, you may need to use the `/scoreboard objectives setdisplay sidebar townstats` command

### Reading the Scoreboard

Each town appears as an entry in the format:
```
TownName:ON [42] - 15
```

Where:
- `TownName` is the name of the town
- `:ON` indicates tourist spawning is enabled (or `:OFF` if disabled)
- `[42]` shows the total number of visitors the town has received
- `15` (the score value) shows the current population of the town

### Automatic Updates

The scoreboard updates automatically whenever:
- A new town is created
- A town's population changes
- Tourist spawning is enabled or disabled
- Tourists visit a town

## Admin Commands

BusinessCraft includes administrative commands to help server operators manage the mod's functionality.

### Clear Towns Command

The `/cleartowns` command allows server operators to remove all towns from the world:

- **Usage**: `/cleartowns`
- **Permission Level**: Requires operator permission level 2
- **Effect**: Removes all towns from the world, including their data, blocks, and associated entities
- **Feedback**: Displays a message indicating how many towns were cleared

This command is particularly useful for:
