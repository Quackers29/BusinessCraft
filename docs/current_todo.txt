## 2. Platform System Improvements

### 2.1. Default Platform Configuration
- [x] 2.1.1. Default platform layout - Implement first platform as default to a new new town with designated X for spawn location and O for nothing and T for the town block, in the orientation the block was placed in (i.e start 3 blocks to the left of the town block): 
"
X
X
X
X
X O O T
"

### 2.2. Platform Assignment
